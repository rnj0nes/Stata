{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd: mcrnj} prepares a two-panel plot. The left panel is a
scatterplot of {it:yvar} by {it:xvar}. Reference lines at
{it:yvar=xvar} and {it:yvar=xvarÂ±caliper} are shown. The
points in the scatterplot are colored according to whether
they are within or outside of the caliper. A predicted line
using {it:modeltype} (restricted cubic spline regression
[modeltype(rcs)] or Deming regression [modeltype(deming)]) is
shown. Two sets of 1-{it:alpha}% confidence regions (with
critical values from the {it:t} distribution), one (narrower,
gold color) using using the standard error of estimate  -- for
comparing within the sample -- and the other (wider, taupe
color) using the standard error of prediction -- for
prediction out of sample -- are shown. The right panel is the
scatterplot with {it:yvar} and derivatives centered at
{it:xvar}.

{p 4 4 2}
Use of the  {hi: modeltype(}{it:deming}{hi:)} option requires
the {it:deming} module be installed. If you don't have it
installed try typing  {hi: findit deming}.
